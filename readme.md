# Get Spotify Access Token

As Spotify disabled unauthenticated calls to the Web API and an access token is required to call `/v1/search` and `/v1/artists/:id` endpoints, my [React Music Search app](https://github.com/zsoltime/react-music-search) didn't work any more. Spodify is just a simple API to get an access token.
